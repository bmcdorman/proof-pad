To run Proof Pad on Linux, you'll need an up-to-date copy of Java (6 or above).

Run proofpad.jar using Java (try double clicking, right click > OpenJDK Java 6 Runtime, etc. Or just do:

$ java -jar proofpad.jar

from the command line).

If you want to make a nice shortcut, you can create and install a .desktop file using the command "java -jar /path/to/proofpad.jar", and the icon "/path/to/proofpad_icon.png". These have to be absolute paths, so I couldn't make this file in advance without having an installer script. More about .desktop files:
